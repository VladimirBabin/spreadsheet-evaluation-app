# Broken Evaluator

This is a broken implementation of evaluator.

There are 11 types of formulas with some of them being broken and returning the wrong type or value. One sheet is also returned as null (sheet-32):

- SUM (BROKEN)
- MULTIPLY
- DIVIDE
- GT (Greater than) (BROKEN)
- LT (Less than)
- EQ (Equals)
- NOT (BROKEN)
- AND
- OR
- IF
- CONCAT (BROKEN)

For more details on running, please refer to README.md in evaluator module.
